## 🏛️ Software Design Choices & Justification

*Design decisions and architectural choices made by Aharnish Dwivedi with AI assistance to create a robust and scalable solution.*

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Clean Architecture**: Chosen for maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns
   - Domain layer contains business logic and interfaces
   - Use case layer orchestrates business operations
   - Infrastructure layer handles external dependencies
   - Presentation layer manages HTTP concerns

2. **Echo Framework**: Selected for its performance, middleware support, and simplicity
   - Built-in CORS support
   - Excellent error handling
   - Lightweight and fast

3. **MySQL Database**: Chosen for reliability and ACID compliance
   - Proper indexing for performance
   - ENUM types for data integrity
   - Timestamp fields for audit trails

4. **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-3.5 Turbo for cost-effectiveness and accuracy
   - Structured JSON responses
   - Low temperature for consistent classification
   - Fallback mechanisms for invalid responses

### Database Schema Design

```sql
CREATE TABLE incidents (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    affected_service VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ai_severity ENUM('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical') NOT NULL,
    ai_category ENUM('Network', 'Software', 'Hardware', 'Security', 'Database', 'Application', 'Infrastructure') NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_created_at (created_at),
    INDEX idx_ai_severity (ai_severity),
    INDEX idx_ai_category (ai_category)
);
```

### Frontend Design

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies for simplicity
- **Modern CSS**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, responsive design
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after incident creation

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Environment variable management for sensitive data
- Error messages don't expose internal system details

## 📈 Monitoring & Logging

- Structured logging for all operations
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- Database query monitoring
